Creating an entire e-commerce front page involves various components such as header, navigation menu, product sections, and footer. Below is a simple example of an e-commerce front page in HTML. This is a basic template, and you might need to customize it further based on your specific requirements, design, and functionality.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your E-commerce Store</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        header {
            background-color: #333;
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 10px;
        }

        nav {
            background-color: #444;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px;
            text-align: center;
        }

        section {
            padding: 20px;
        }

        footer {
            background-color: #333;
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 10px;
            position: absolute;
            bottom: 0;
            width: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>Your E-commerce Store</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <a href="#">Home</a> |
        <a href="#">Products</a> |
        <a href="#">Contact</a>
    </nav>

    <section>
        <h2>Featured Products</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Product 1</h3>
            <p>Description of Product 1. Price: $20.00</p>
            <button>Add to Cart</button>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Product 2</h3>
            <p>Description of Product 2. Price: $25.00</p>
            <button>Add to Cart</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Add more product sections as needed -->
    </section>

    <footer>
        &copy; 2023 Your E-commerce Store. All rights reserved.
    </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

This is a basic example, and you might want to add more features such as images, product categories, dynamic content, and interactivity using JavaScript. Additionally, you would need a backend system to handle product data, user authentication, and other functionalities for a complete e-commerce website.
